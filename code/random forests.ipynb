    "Random forests and boosting are ensemble methods used for classification and regression, but in this particular case I'll be focusing on classification. Random forests are essentially a collection of decision trees that are each fit on a subsample of the data. While an individual tree is typically noisey and subject to high variance, random forests average many different trees to reduce the variability and leave us with a powerful classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests are also non-parametric and require little to no parameter tuning. They differ from many common machine learning models used today that are typically optimized using gradient descent. Models like linear regression, support vector machines, neural networks, etc. require a lot of matrix based operations, while on the other hand tree based models like random forest are constructed with just basic arithmetic. In other words, to build a tree all we're really doing is selecting a hand full of observations and features from our dataset and finding the value that makes the best split. We'll define what what it means to be the \"best split\" in a bit..\n"

    "A quick overview if you're not familiar with binary decision trees. We start from very top, which is called the *root node* and ask a simple question. If the answer to the question is correct we'll move to the left node directly connected below, otherwise if wrong we'll move down to the right node. We'll repeat this process until we reach one of the bottom nodes, which are called the *terminal nodes*. For classification the terminal nodes output the class that is the mode while in the context of regression they'll output the mean prediction. The problem with this method of finding the best split point is that it is a rather greedy approach and is subject to high variance when trees aren't pruned. Pruning is essentially the process of trimming off nodes that output little predictive power to reduce overfitting, however, random forests don't require pruning for simplicity and account for overfitting through other techniques like bootstrapping and bagging which we'll soon cover."

If our dataset has $n$ observations **bootstrapping** is the process of sampling $n$ points **with** replacement. We can actually calculate that the probability an observation is omitted from our bootstrapped dataset is  $(1 - \\frac{1}{n})^{n}$. By definition $e^{-1} = \\displaystyle \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}(1-\\frac{1}{n})^n$ and since $e^{-1}$ = 0.36787.. $\\approx \\frac{1}{3}$ $\\Rightarrow$ bootstrapping $n$ samples with replacement will leave out approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the observations in each distinct tree. Since each individual tree is built using only $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the data we'll  find that most trees will differ from one another.

After we've built our tree with the *n* bootstrapped observations we can test each $\\vec{x}_i$ that was left out and compute the mean prediction error for all the OOB samples, which we can record as the trees OOB score. Taking the mean of all the OOB scores give us our random forests OOB error, this is essentially **leave-one-out cross validation**. This ultimately tells us how accurate our model is without having to formally test it and we'll soon find that it is approximately the same error rate we'll get at test time."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this was of use for anyone curious to learn about random forests. Random forests are great simply because of how easy they are to implement and require little to no parameter tuning. The amount of complexity from RF's compared to other models like neural network or gradient boosting models gives them an advantage in that they offer a lot more interprebility. There are methods that can allow you to see which variables are more important to others that I didn't cover in this thread but are worth checkig out. Hopefully this can help you get in the right direction if you are also interested in understanding how gradient boosting models like Xgboost work. "
